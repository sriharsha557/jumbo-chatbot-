Perfect 👍 since you’re using **Streamlit Secrets** for the API key, your `requirements.txt` just needs to list the Python packages required for your app.

Here’s a clean `requirements.txt` for your code:

```txt
streamlit==1.37.1
python-dotenv==1.0.1
langchain-groq==0.0.2
crewai==0.28.8
chromadb==0.5.5
plotly==5.23.0
pandas==2.2.2
textblob==0.18.0.post0
```

---

### 🔍 Notes:

* `streamlit` → runs your app.
* `python-dotenv` → loads `.env` files locally (won’t be needed on Streamlit Cloud, but safe to keep).
* `langchain-groq` → for Groq integration.
* `crewai` → your agent framework.
* `chromadb` → for vector DB.
* `plotly` → for charts (`express` + `graph_objects`).
* `pandas` → data handling.
* `textblob` → sentiment analysis.
