Perfect 👍 since you’re using **Streamlit Secrets** for the API key, your `requirements.txt` just needs to list the Python packages required for your app.

Here’s a clean `requirements.txt` for your code:

```txt
streamlit
python-dotenv
langchain-groq
crewai
chromadb
plotly
pandas
textblob
```

---

### 🔍 Notes:

* `streamlit` → runs your app.
* `python-dotenv` → loads `.env` files locally (won’t be needed on Streamlit Cloud, but safe to keep).
* `langchain-groq` → for Groq integration.
* `crewai` → your agent framework.
* `chromadb` → for vector DB.
* `plotly` → for charts (`express` + `graph_objects`).
* `pandas` → data handling.
* `textblob` → sentiment analysis.
